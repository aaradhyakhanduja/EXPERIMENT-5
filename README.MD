# Experiment-5

# Aim 
The aim of the provided C++ code is to demonstrate the use of conditional statements (if-else ladder, nested if, and switch-case) in a programming context.

# Theory

1. if-else Ladder
An if-else ladder is a series of if statements that are used to execute different blocks of code based on multiple conditions. It helps in choosing one block of code among many based on boolean expressions:

2. Nested if Statements
Nested if statements are used to further evaluate conditions within an already established if or else block

3. switch-case
The switch-case statement allows execution of code blocks based on the value of a variable. It provides an alternative to multiple if-else statements:

# Code: 
<br>

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,b,c;
    cout<<"if-else ladder"<<endl;
    cout<<"Enter the first number: ";
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Enter the second number: ";
    cin>>b;
    cout<<"Enter the third number: ";
    cin>>c;
// if-elif-else ladder
    if ((a>b) && (a>c))
    {
        cout<<"First number is the largest."<<endl;
    }

    else if ((b>a) && (b>c))
    {
        cout<<"Second number is the largest."<<endl;
    }

    else
    {
        cout<<"Third number is the largest."<<endl;
    }
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<endl;

//nested if
    cout<<"nested if"<<endl;
     if ((a>b) && (a>c))
    {
        if (b>c)
        cout<<"Sum of first and second number: "<<a+b<<endl;
        else
        cout<<"Sum of first and third number: "<<a+c<<endl;
    }
    else if ((b>a) && (b>c))
    {
        if (a>c)
        cout<<"Subtraction of second and first number: "<<b-a<<endl;
        else
        cout<<"Subtraction of second and third number: "<<b-c<<endl;
    }
    else
    {
        if (a<b)
        cout<<"Product of third and first number: "<<c*a<<endl;
        else
        cout<<"Product of third and second number: "<<c*b<<endl;
    }

    cout<<endl;
    cout<<endl;
    //switch case
    cout<<"switch case"<<endl;
    int ch;
    float ans;
    cout<<"Enter the first number: ";
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Enter the second number: ";
    cin>>b;
    cout<<"Press 1 for addition."<<endl;
    cout<<"Press 2 for subtraction. "<<endl;
    cout<<"Press 3 for multiplication. "<<endl;
    cout<<"Press 4 for division"<<endl;
    cout<<"Enter your choice: ";
    cin>>ch;

    switch (ch)
    {
    case 1:
    {
        ans = a + b;
        cout<<"Sum: "<<ans;
        break;
    }

    case 2:
    {
        ans = a - b;
        cout<<"Subtraction: "<<ans;
        break;
    }
    
    case 3:
    {
        ans = a * b;
        cout<<"Product: "<<ans;
        break;
    }

        case 4:
    {
        ans = a / b;
        cout<<"Division "<<ans;
        break;
    }

    default:
    {
        cout<<"INVALID INPUT";
    }
        break;
    }
}
